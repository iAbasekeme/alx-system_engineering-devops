==>Role of Firewalls
Firewalls added to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic, enhancing security.
One firewall for each server (web servers, application servers, and database servers) and provides a security layer for each component.
Firewalls serve as a critical component of network security, acting as a barrier between a trusted internal network and 
untrusted external networks (such as the internet). Firewalls control and monitor network traffic, 
enhancing security by filtering and blocking unauthorized access.

==> Role of HTTPS and SSL
1. SSL terminator at the load balancer ensures that the traffic between the user and the load balancer is encrypted,
providing an additional layer of security. It is used to authenticate the identity of a website and if true the data
exchange can be done using https encryption. So SSL certificates provides a secure communication channel between 
a client(such as a web browser) and a server.
  -How it works: During a TLS handshake, the client and server negotiate encryption parameters, including the choice of cryptographic 
  algorithms and the exchange of cryptographic keys.
2. HTTPS encrypt data in transit between the userâ€™s browser and the web server, preventing eavesdropping and ensuring data privacy
  -How it works: HTTPS uses cryptographic protocols (such as TLS/SSL) to encrypt data, making it unreadable to anyone who might intercept 
  it during transmission.
  - Benefit: Encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal details, and financial transactions,
  remains confidential.
SSL/TLS certificates are used to authenticate the website's identity. Browsers verify these certificates to establish trust.
Why it's added: To encrypt traffic between the user's browser and the web server, ensuring data privacy. 
Ensures that the SSL certificate is valid for the specific domain.
So  HTTPS and SSL both play a crutial role on website and communication security.

===> Role of monitoring:
Monitoring is used to ensure the health and performance of the infrastructure, detect issues proactively, and provide insights
for optimization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring tools collect data frol various sources within a system or infrastructure. Here are common ways monotoring tools collect data:
1. Agent-Based Monitoring: 
Monitoring agents are installed on individual servers, workstations, or devices. These agents collect data locally and send it 
to a centralized monitoring server. Some monitoring tools operate without requiring agents. 
2. Agentless Monitoring:
Some monitoring tools operate without requiring agents. They use protocols like SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
to gather information from network devices.
3. Logs and Log File Monitoring:
Monitoring tools parse log files generated by applications, operating systems, or devices. They extract relevant information for analysis.
4. API-Based Monitoring:
Some tools integrate with APIs exposed by applications or services to retrieve performance metrics and status information.
5. Network Packet Analysis:
Tools analyze network traffic and capture packets to understand communication patterns, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues.
6. Synthetic Monitoring:
Simulated transactions or requests are generated to monitor system behavior and response times from an end-user perspective.
7. End-to-End Monitoring:
Comprehensive monitoring of the entire application stack, including user interactions, application performance, server health, and database performance.
8. Custom Scripts and Probes:
Administrators can create custom scripts or probes to collect specific metrics or check the status of custom applications or services.

Monitoring tools often use a combination of these methods to provide a comprehensive view of system health and performance. 
The collected data is then analyzed, aggregated, and presented through dashboards, alerts, and reports to help administrators make 
informed decisions and take timely actions.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
1. Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:
This approach means that the traffic between the load balancer and backend servers is unencrypted, introducing a potential security risk.

2. Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure for write operations. 
Consider setting up multiple write-capable nodes or using advanced database clustering solutions.

3. Identical Components on Servers:
Having servers with identical components (database, web server, application server) might be a problem for scalability and fault tolerance.
